# Micromouse

In this student project at the Technical University of Munich we engineered a mobile robot from scratch. The final report is available at [report.pdf](report.pdf).

This repository currently contains the Schematic and PCB design files ([eagle/](eagle/)), PDFs thereof ([schematic_pcb_pdfs/](schematic_pcb_pdfs/)), and some MATLAB scripts concerning trajectory generation ([matlab/](matlab/)).

TODO: Add (additional) C, CAD, MATLAB/Simulink, and potentially some PCB library files.
